    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this project we implemented a cloth simulator capable of simulating physical interactions on a patch of cloth, as well as incorporating 
        collisions with basic geometries such as spheres and planes, self-collision, and a variety of shaders.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
    <p>
        The first step to simulating our cloth is to create the cloth representation as a grid of point masses and springs. A Cloth object stores this
        information in two vectors that hold pointers to PointMass and Spring objects. The vectors are populated using Cloth::buildGrid(). To start, the
        function caches all possible x and y PointMass coordinates in cloth space into two separate vectors using known information about the number of
        points along each dimension and the overall height and width of the cloth. It then uses two nested for loops (iterating on the index of the point
        in its dimension) to populate the PointMass vector appropriately. The indices from the for loops is used to look up whether the current point is
        pinned using find() on the Cloth's <i>pinned</i> vector, which holds integer vectors representing grid indices of pinned (non-moving) PointMasses.
        PointMasses are emplaced differently depending on their orientation, which is stored in a Cloth enum. If the cloth is horizontal, the PointMasses
        vary across the XZ plane and all have an initial Y coordinate of 1 in world space. However, if the cloth is vertical, the PointMasses vary across
        the XY plane and have a random Z coordinate from -0.001 to 0.001 in order to allow the cloth to crumple on itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once all PointMasses have been initialized properly, the function populates the Spring vector in order to represent the various structural,
        shearing, and bending constraints between the cloth's PointMasses. A Spring constructor takes the addresses of the two PointMasses it connects,
        as well as an enum value representing the type of constraint it represents. A for loop iterates through all objects in the PointMass vector and
        adds half of the possible Springs that connect to that PointMass, which prevents the addition of duplicate Springs. For each PointMass, the following
        constraint Springs are added where possible:
        <ul>
            <li>Structural constraints are added connecting the current PointMass to the PointMasses to the left and above it.</li>
            <li>Shearing constraints are added connecting the current PointMass to the PointMasses to the diagonal upper left and diagonal upper right of it.</li>
            <li>Bending constraints are added connecting the current PointMass to the PointMasses two to the left and two above it.</li>
        </ul>
        Since some of these cannot be added for PointMasses near the edges of the cloth, the function converts the current loop index into grid indices, which
        can be easily used to determine if a point is too close to the left or top edges of the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following images show the wireframe of <i>pinned2.json</i> in the simulator. Lines represent springs connecting point masses.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
    <p>
        The next step is to simulate movement of the cloth model. Besides external forces such as gravity which affect all point masses in the
        cloth equally, the model also experiences spring correction forces between point masses which keep the cloth together and are computed
        based on the positions of connected point masses relative to each other. The <i>simulate()</i> function calculates and applies movement
        to the cloth at every time step. First, the total force acting on each point mass is calculated as a sum of the external forces and spring
        correction forces acting on it. The former is calculated using <i>external_accelerations</i>, a vector of Vector3D objects which is supplied
        to the function as an argument, and the latter is calculated using Hooke's law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every PointMass contains a Vector3D which is used to store the sum of its applied forces at each time step. At the beginning of each
        <i>simulate()</i> call, these are first zeroed out and then set equal to the total external forces. The function then iterates through
        each spring in the wireframe and (for springs whose constraint type is enabled) calculates the force applied to the masses it connects
        using the positions of those masses, and the Spring's rest length and spring constant. This force is applied to one of the masses, and an
        equal and opposite force is applied to the other. For bending springs, only 20% of the force is applied because bending constraints are
        weaker than structural and shearing constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        The calculated forces are then used to update the positions of each unpinned point mass using Verlet integration. Given a point mass's
        current position, velocity, and acceleration, Verlet integration calculates the point mass's new position at a time interval dt later as:
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/verlet.png" align="middle" width="600" /></center>
    <p>
        Each PointMass stores its position at the previous timestep x<sub>t-dt</sub> in addition to its current position, which allows the velocity
        term v<sub>t</sub> * dt to be approximated as x<sub>t</sub> - x<sub>t-dt</sub>. The velocity term is also multiplied by a damping term (1-d)
        to simulate loss of energy due to friction, air resistance, etc. Acceleration can be calculated by dividing the forces acting on a point mass
        by its mass. The final position update equation is thus
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/verlet-update.png" align="middle" width="600" /></center>
    <p>
        As a final step, we apply the constraint that springs may deform by no more than 10% of their resting length, in order to prevent
        unreasonably large stretching of the cloth. For each spring, we check if the distance between the attached point masses is too long, and update
        their positions if so, applying half the correction to each. If one of the point masses is pinned, the entire correction is applied to the
        unpinned point mass.
    </p>

    <figcaption align="center"><i>pinned4.json</i> at rest.</figcaption>
    <p>
        We can make a number of observations of the cloth's behavior when its density, spring constant, and damping are changed. We use
        <i>pinned2.json</i> as an example, and vary in orders of magnitude when possible. If the cloth's density or spring constant is
        taken to an extreme, the cloth vanishes and the simulation breaks. The color of the cloth represents the direction of the normal vector at
        that point; green locations point directly upwards.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/2-base.png" align="middle" /></center>
    <figcaption align="center"><i>pinned2.json</i> at rest.</figcaption>
    <p>
        As the cloth falls, we observe diagonal folds that ripple from the pinned corners to the free end of the cloth. At rest, the top
        edge of the cloth sags somewhat, and the top corners are creased.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/2-high-density.png" align="middle" width="400" />
                    <figcaption align="center">Cloth with 10x density.</figcaption>

        </table>
    </div>
    <p>
        When density is increased by a factor of 10, the top edge sags more, and an extra wrinkle appears as the cloth folds on itself an
        additional time. When the cloth falls, the diagonal ripples that originate at the pinned corners are slightly stronger, as well as the
        ripples that begin at the free end of the cloth when it hits its nadir. The same effect can be achieved by reducing the spring constant
        by a factor of 10, which makes intuitive sense: denser cloth particles and weaker corrective spring forces will both lead to more
        deformation of the cloth as it falls.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>

            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>
        With another factor of 10, the cloth sags even more, but also begins to destabilize. Ripples appear everywhere, even when the cloth
        appears to have come to rest. Previously existing ripples also intensify.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>

    <p>
        On the other hand, when density is decreased or spring constant is increased by a factor of 10, the cloth becomes more planar.
        Ripples are weaker, and the final resting state of the cloth is noticeably less creased than the original cloth. The bottom edge
        also remains relatively straight as it falls, whereas the high density/low spring constant cloth's bottom edge curves as it reaches
        the end of its movement due to the diagonal ripples from the pinned corners.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">

                <td>

    </div>
    <p>
        When density is too low or spring constant is too high, the cloth ceases to obey conventional laws of physics and begins spinning
        rapidly about the axis formed by the pinned points, appearing to implode continuously. Even if parameters are later restored to
        normal levels, the cloth usually experiences some uncorrectable self-collision that prevents the cloth from returning to its original
        geometry and requires the simulation to be completely reset. This appears to be caused by a positive feedback loop of overcorrection
        when cloth particles are too light or spring forces are too strong (or a combination of both).
    </p>

        <table style="width=100%">

    <p>
        The effects of damping are more straightforward. By default, damping is set to 0.2%, but increasing or decreasing it will change
        the time the cloth takes to come to rest. When damping is turned off entirely, the cloth does not stop upon reaching the original
        resting orientation, but continues to swing upwards to the original height it started to fall at. The free corners of the cloth
        exhibit a larger range of motion compared to when damping is on, and the cloth oscillates indefinitely. With low damping, the cloth
        swings back and forth a few times but eventually comes to a halt. When damping is set to its maximum value of 1%, the cloth falls
        very slowly, as if through molasses, barely rippling at all.
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
    <p>
        To make the cloth simulation more interesting, we include collision handling to spheres and planes. If the update calculated in the
        previous step would move a point mass across the boundary of a sphere or plane, we apply a correction so that it does not, and
        additionally account for friction by scaling the correction vector down a small amount. The <i>simulate()</i> function takes a vector
        of pointers to CollisionObjects (spheres or planes, in our case) as an argument. Within each <i>simulate()</i> call, we check each
        point mass for collision with all existing CollisionObjects and handle it accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The correction vector applied to a point mass involved in a collision bumps the point mass to near the surface of the object where
        they collided. To calculate the point mass's new position, we find the tangent point (i.e. where the point mass should have intersected
        the object), compute the correction needed to be applied to the point mass's previous position in order to reach the tangent point, and
        finally scale the correction vector down by the friction factor and update the new position accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        For spheres, we can use the distance between the point mass's position and the sphere's origin to easily check if intersection has occured.
        We find the tangent point by extending the line connecting the point mass and the sphere's origin, and the correction vector is found by
        simple vector subtraction.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/3-5000.png" align="middle" /></center>
    <figcaption align="center"><i>sphere.json</i> at rest with default parameters.</figcaption>
    <p>
        The cloth comes to a halt on top of the sphere above, and creases in several places as the square geometry attempts to conform to the
        shape of the sphere. The cloth splays out slightly due to the stiffness of the cloth.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/3-500.png" align="middle" /></center>
    <figcaption align="center"><i>sphere.json</i> at rest with ks=500.</figcaption>
    <p>
        With a weaker spring constant, the cloth creases in many more places as it hangs off the sphere. Since the cloth is less stiff, the
        free ends hang more vertically than they did with the larger spring constant.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/3-50000.png" align="middle" /></center>
    <figcaption align="center"><i>sphere.json</i> at rest with ks=50000.</figcaption>
    <p>
        When the spring constant is stronger, the cloth resists creasing, and only folds in a few places. It splays out much more than either of
        the two other simulations, since the increased spring constant prevents the cloth masses from moving as far.
    </p>
    <p>
        Planes are slightly trickier. To find the tangent point, we calculate the vector between the point mass and the point defining the plane,
        project that onto the normal vector defining the plane, and subtract the result (the shortest vector between the point mass and the plane)
        from the position of the point mass. Then, since we want to move the point mass to a location slightly above the plane, we calculate this
        position by subtracting the plane's normal vector scaled by a provided constant SURFACE_OFFSET from the tangent point. We then compute the
        required correction vector, scale it down by friction, and update the point mass's position, as for spheres.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/3-plane.png" align="middle" /></center>
    <figcaption align="center"><i>plane.json</i> at rest with default parameters.</figcaption>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
    <p>
        In some cases, the cloth may fall onto itself. If the simulator has no way of handling self-collisions, the cloth will not behave appropriately
        in these cases. This can be demonstrated in <i>selfCollision.json</i>.
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/4-inf.png" align="middle" /></center>
    <figcaption align="center">Peering into the infinite.</figcaption>
    <p>
        We may attempt to implement this by following the same technique as we did for CollisionObjects, but such an approach would require us to
        iterate over all possible pairs of point masses and check for collision, which is too inefficient for most real-time simulations. We instead
        simplify the problem by implementing spatial hashing; we divide the global space into identical 3D box volumes and sort all point masses into
        buckets based on the volume they occupy. This allows us to check each point mass against only those point masses within some distance of it,
        and ignore those further away. We build the spatial hash map at every time step, and use it to apply repulsive correction forces to point masses
        if they are too close to each other, as in the previous part.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may observe <i>selfCollision.json</i> as before.

        When density is increased or spring constant is decreased, the cloth crumples much more on itself as it falls. In these cases, the
        weight of the cloth is too much for the springs to push, and the resting state is more compact.

        Conversely, when density is decreased or spring constant is increased, the cloth makes much neater folds as it falls to the plane.
        The corrective spring forces push the cloth out from under itself as it falls, resulting in a wider footprint at rest.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>
    <p>
        A shader program accelerates part of the renderline pipeline by running them on GPU. A GPU contains hundreds of processing cores
        able to compute large numbers of simple operations in parallel, which makes operations like raytracing much faster than would be
        possible by a CPU, which has fewer cores specialized for more complex tasks. Shaders output single 4D vectors.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Vertex shaders modify the geometry of the mesh to be rendered by changing vertex positions or normal vectors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fragment shaders use geometric attributes of a rasterized fragment to output a color.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Our shader programs link a vertex shader to a fragment shader, with the vertex shader output becoming the fragment shader input.
        In this part we incorporate shaders for Blinn-Phong shading, texture shading, bump mapping, displacement mapping, and mirror shading.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Blinn-Phong shading model combines three forms of reflective lighting:
        <ul>
            <li>
                ambient light, which illuminates objects uniformly based on the object's surroundings;
            </li>
            <li>
                diffuse light, formed when incoming light rays are scattered at many angles, creating a dull appearance;
            </li>
            <li>
                and specular light, formed when incoming light rays are mostly reflected in a single direction, creating a shiny highlight.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Each form of light has an associated coefficient which varies based on the shininess of the object and brightness of the
        surroundings. Because ambient light illuminates objects uniformly, it does not incorporate a ray direction vector in its
        calculation, in contrast with diffuse and specular lighting. The resulting image appears more realistic than an image
        rendered with any of the individual lighting components alone would. A fragment shader alone can calculate the vector
        equations required to render the object properly; no significant changes are made with the vertex shader.

        Texture mapping allows an existing texture asset (an image or photo) to be drawn onto the object surface. Again, a fragment shader
        can easily accomplish this in one instruction.

        Bump mapping can give detail to lit objects by modifying their surface normals using a height map stored in a texture. Though it
        doesn't change the object's geometry (in the sense that no vertices are moved, created, or deleted), the modified normals cause
        light to interact differently, so more detail is shown in the light's reflections. This is done using a fragment shader.

        Displacement mapping uses a vertex shader to change the vertices' positions so they reflect the height map (scaled by a
        variable). It uses the same fragment shader as bumpmapping, but also changes the geometry of the object. The resolution
        of the object will affect the result of the displacement mapping; if the resolution is too low, the changes to the vertices
        may not accurately reflect the map or may result in unintended blockiness.

        If we want to simulate the appearance of a mirror, we can use an environment map to sample radiance. We first compute an
        outgoing ray using a fragment's position and the camera position. We can then reflect this ray about the normal at the fragment
        to get an incoming ray, which we can finally use to sample the environment map.
